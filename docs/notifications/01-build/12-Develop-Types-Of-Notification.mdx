| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Broadcast         | 1          | This type of notification is broadcasted or sent to all the subscribers of a channel at once. |
| Targeted          | 3          | This type of notification is sent to a single wallet address.                                 |
| Subset            | 4          | This type of notification is sent to a a subset (or a group) of your channel subscribers.     |

  notification: { title: 'test', body: 'test' },
});
```

```typescript
// userAlice.channel.send([recipients], {options?})
// to send a targeted notification - pass that single wallet address in recipients array
const targetedNotif = await userAlice.channel.send(
  ['0x99A08ac6254dcf7ccc37CeC662aeba8eFA666666'],
  {
    notification: {

    },
  }
);
```

```typescript
// userAlice.channel.send([recipients], {options?})
// to send a subset notification - pass the list of wallet address in recipients array

  [
    randomWallet1,
